# ü§ñ Robot Arm Automation Project

Welcome to the Robot Arm Automation Project! This guide will help you understand the project and get it up and running in no time.

## üìñ Project Overview

This project involves automating a robot arm using an Arduino board. The goal is to create a robotic system that can perform tasks autonomously, such as picking and placing objects.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

Here's a quick look at the project files:

- **/code**: Contains the Arduino code files.
- **/schematics**: Circuit diagrams and connection schematics.
- **/documentation**: Additional project documentation and resources.
- **README.md**: This file, explaining how to set up and use the project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your robot arm automation project up and running:

### 1. Gather the Required Components

You'll need the following components:

- Arduino Uno
- Robot arm kit
- Servomotors
- Power supply
- Breadboard and jumper wires

### 2. Clone the Repository

First, download the project files. Open your terminal and run:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Robot-Arm-Automation.git
cd Robot-Arm-Automation
\`\`\`

### 3. Install the Arduino IDE

Make sure you have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. You can download it from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### 4. Open the Arduino Code

Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to `File > Open`. Select the `.ino` file located in the `/code` directory of this project.

### 5. Connect the Components

Follow the schematics provided in the `/schematics` folder to connect your robot arm to the Arduino board.

### 6. Upload the Code

Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB. In the Arduino IDE, select the correct board and port from the `Tools` menu. Then, click the upload button to upload the code to your Arduino.

### 7. Test the Robot Arm

Once the code is uploaded, your robot arm should start performing the programmed tasks. Make sure all connections are secure and observe the arm's movements.
